# Configuration Management

With the launch of Drupal 8 comes a unified way of storing your site and Extension (themes, modules and plugins) configuration data. The product of the Configuration Management Initiative, the Configuration System allows for a very effecive development workflow, when leveraging tools like Drush and Git. It's not limited to developers however, the Drupal UI provides forms for managing your site's configuration too.

To get started with this material, check out this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/DrupalizeMe/transcode_profile.git
```

Import the "drupal-8.0.0-base.sql" to a mysql database called 'drupal'.

A mysql user 'drupal', with a password of 'drupal' should be granted access to the 'drupal' database.

You can otherwise update the user, password, and database in name in your **docroot/sites/default/settings.php**

## Check out the module
